<p><h1>CDN control</h1>
- The CDN gets to decide *what* code is delivered to *which* users. Could be a prime target for, say, another FERRETCANNON.
- If the CDN is compromised, so is your site.
- If an attacker on a local network manages to inject poisoned cache data into requests for said CDN, your site is compromised.
- All of your visitors are disclosed to the CDN owner.
- If the CDN goes down, your site does so, too. Note that the inverse doesn't apply: the CDNs superior availability has no positive effect on your site.
- Loading from another host may cause an unnecessary DNS lookup and will cause an unnecessary TLS connection.
